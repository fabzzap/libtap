/* TAP shared library: a library for converting audio data (as a stream of
 * PCM signed 32-bit samples, mono) to raw TAP data and back
 * 
 * TAP specification was written by Per Hï¿½kan Sundell and is available at
 * http://www.computerbrains.com/tapformat.html
 * 
 * The algorithm for TAP encoding was originally written by Janne Veli
 * Kujala, based on the one written by Andreas Matthies for Tape64.
 * Some modifications and adaptation to library format by Fabrizio Gennari
 *
 * The algorithm to decode TAP data into square, sine or triangular waves
 * is by Fabrizio Gennari.
